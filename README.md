# 📧 Email Application — Java Project

This is a simple yet powerful Java-based Email Application designed to simulate basic email functionality within a company. Built entirely using Core Java, the project is an ideal demonstration of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as encapsulation, method abstraction, and class design.

## 🚀 Features

* 🔐 Auto-generates a secure random password
* 📧 Generates company-specific email based on user department
* 📦 Allows setting and modifying mailbox capacity
* 📨 Enables alternate email configuration
* 🔑 Allows users to change their password securely
* 📋 Displays user details including full name, email, and settings

## 💡 What You'll Learn

* Java class and object creation
* Constructor overloading and encapsulation
* Use of Math functions to generate random passwords
* Input handling via Scanner
* Structuring code using multiple classes
* Real-world simulation of data management

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. User inputs first and last name.
2. Chooses a department from options (Sales, Development, Accounting, or None).
3. Application generates:

   * Department-based email address
   * Random password
   * Default mailbox capacity (500MB)
4. User can:

   * Set an alternate email
   * Change the mailbox capacity
   * Change the password
5. Final user profile is displayed on the console.
